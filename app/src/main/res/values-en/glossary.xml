    <string name="faqone">What is CD4 Count?</string>
    <string name="answerone">
        CD4 (T4 helper) cells are immune cells.\n 
        The count is measured per unit (mm3) of blood\n 
        and indicates the health of the immune system.\n 
        The normal range is between 500 - 1500.
    </string>
	<string name="faqtwo">What is CD4\u0025?</string>
	<string name="answertwo">
	    The ratio between 2 different immune cells\n, 
	    T4 (helper CD4) and T8(killer CD8) cells.\n 
	    The ratio is given in \u0025. The CD4\u0025 value indicates\n 
	    the health of the immune system.\n 
	    CD4\u0025 tends to fluctuate less than CD4 count .\n 
	    The normal range is between 20-40\u0025.

    <string name="faqthree">What is Viral Load?</string>
    <string name="answerthree">The amount of HIV virus in blood (measured as per unit blood mm3).</string>
    <string name="faqfour">What does \'Undetectable\' mean?</string>
    <string name="answerfour">
        Undetectable refers to a very low count of HIV virus in blood.\n 
        The threshold for \'undetectable\' depends on the Viral Load test\n 
        and may range from 50 to ca 200.\n 
        Undetectable does not mean\n the virus has left the body.

	<string name="faqfive">When to start HIV treatment?</string>
	<string name="answerfive">
	    Current guidelines recommend the start of treatment \n 
	    when the CD4 count is persistently at or below 350.

	<string name="faqsix">What anti-HIV drugs are available?</string>
	<string name="answersix">
	    A whole range of different drug types are available \n 
	    and new ones are developed all the time. The 5 main types are:\n 
	    protease inhibitors, NRTI (nukes), NNRTI (non-nukes),\n 
	    fusion/entry inhibitors and integrase inhibitors. \n 
	    Often patients are prescribed drugs that combine more than 1 type (e.g. Atripla).

	<string name="faqseven">How do anti-HIV drugs work?</string>
	<string name="answerseven">
	    When HIV infects a cell it \'reprogrammes\' the cell to produce new virus copies.\n 
	    This typically leads to the death of the infected cell.\n 
	    HIV drugs prevent the virus from multiplying within the infected cell.

	<string name="faqeight">
	    What is Adherence?\n
	    And why is it important that I take my drugs regularly?
	</string>
	<string name="answereight">
	    Anti HIV medication needs to be taken regularly - typically within +/- 1 hour \n 
	    of the specified time. Sticking to the drug regime is called \'adherence\'. \n
	    It is important to avoid the virus from becoming resistant to the medication.
